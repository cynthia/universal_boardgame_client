The Universal Boardgame Client is a nascent project with the goal of creating a way of playing board games over the internet much like ZunTzu (http://zuntzu.com) but in a cross platform way. ZunTzu is incredible, but unfortunately it's Windows only and closed source.  

Requires pygame and rabbyt. Windows builds will be made available when we get to the point where we have something worth showing :-).
